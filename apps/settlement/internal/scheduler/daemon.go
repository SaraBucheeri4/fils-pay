// Package scheduler implements the `daemon` subcommand's sleep/wake loop:
// sleeps until the next scheduled run time, then runs the full daily
// batching pass for every active merchant for the business day that just
// completed, then sleeps again. Runs forever until ctx is cancelled
// (main.go wires SIGTERM to cancel it), letting an in-flight batch
// transaction finish (or roll back cleanly) before exiting — no
// transaction is ever left half-committed by a container restart, because
// every batch operation is one Postgres transaction that either fully
// commits or fully rolls back.
